# Analytical solutions of some physical models

When developing algorithms, it is often necessary to benchmark some commonly used models. Here is **a collection of analytical solutions** and **corresponding derivation processes** of some physical models.

The current models are:
1. One-dimensional Ising model;
2. Two-dimensional Ising model;
3. One-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model.
